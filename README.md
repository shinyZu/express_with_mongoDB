# Express JS Backend with MongoDB

<br>

## Take Home Assignment 03

### - for the module Rapid Application Development (RAD)

<br>

## Technology Stack :

- Node JS
- Express JS
- MongoDB
- Postman

#### Node JS:

    -  a free open source server environment that uses JavaScript on the server and runs on various platform (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.).
    - it uses asynchronous programming.

#### Express JS:

    -  a fast, unopiniated, minimalist server/backend framework for Node JS, designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

#### MongoDB:

    - a cross-platform, document-oriented, very popuplar, very powerful, user-friendly NoSQL database.

#### Mongoose:

    - an ODM (Object Document Mapper) that provides a straightforward and schema-based solution to model your application data on top of MongoDB's native drivers.
    - it includes built-in type casting, validation (which enhances MongoDB's native document validation), query building, hooks and more.
    - manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
    - using mongoose, a user can define the schema for the documents in a particular collection.
    - it provides a lot of convenience in the creation and management of data in MongoDB.
    - similar to an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) you would use with a relational database.
    - (MongoDB is not an ODM, it's a Document Database.)

## Packages Used :

#### express

#### mongodb

#### mongoose

<br>

#### dotenv

    - a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.

#### multer

    - a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files.

#### multer-gridfs-storage

    - a storage engine for multer to store uploaded files directly to mongoDB.

#### gridfs-stream

    - to easily stream files to and from MongoDB GridFS.
    - provides more rebus and easier to use streams.

#### jsonwebtoken

    - used to share security information between two parties, using a signed cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued
